# Urban Heartbeat

<!--Overall, I thought this was an excellent oveview. My edits were mainly due to 2 reasons: 1. general copyediting stuff, and 2. bringing full circle the framing of terms, i.e. suggesting reframing a bit the notion of "experiments", introducing the framing of "a search engine" and "curated searches", further defining "pulses", how they fit into "urban hearbeats", etc. Easier option: we could say that pulses=heartbeats. Harder option (cool though if possible): we could define something like, 1 civic search returns a customized pulse. Combined together, multiple pulses = an urban heartbeat. I imagine this could be done (perhaps in another phase if we're interested) via a dash where one could view an aggregated view of all pulses in a place, or perhaps even more interesting, a way to organize pulses into a heartbeat over time?-->

Urban Heartbeat is a civic art project that explores real-time temporal identities and pulses of places in cities around the world. The project is part of the Data Canvas: Sense Your City competition, a DIY sensor network collecting and visualizing open data.

<!--thinking it could be useful to include a goal here, and to introduce our definition of pulses/heartbeat, see my proposal below:-->

The primary goal of Urban Heartbeat is to empower the ability for any citizen to curate their own civic data search, and in turn, return customized search results in the form of information-rich, yet visually simplified format(s), or "pulses". 

Over the course of 2 weeks, our team will begin by building a series of visualization experiments for representing select environmental factors, such as pollution, noise, dust, and light. Check out the latest experiments here: [Link to various Code Pen experiments]. We encourage you to fork these experiments into new ones, and have a say in how you'd like to see your city.

<!--Am I right to assume that before March 20th, we would invite submissions for forked proposals, but ultimately select 1 per factor? I was a bit confused reading the parts about users being able to search contributed experiments and thought we may want to discuss this a bit further, as it was my initial understanding that while we might want to invite others to experiment pre-march 20th, we'd want to make sure the resulting visualization of each factor worked harmoniously to feed into the creation of a given pulse(s)], and that our goal for civic participation would rather be allowing users to customize their own searches by selecting relevant data and cities, viewing their resulting pulse(s)/heartbeats, and adding/comparing to other pulse(s)/heartbeats? Hope that explains some of the fixes I made here re: experiments and such, feel free to correct me if I misunderstood!-->

On March 20th, we'll combine the experiments into a web app/search engine that allows users to curate their own searches and compare pulses across 140 places in 10 international cities. Users will be invited to include select environmental factors as they find relevant to their search. Each environmental factor selected will contribute a "layer" onto a resulting urban pulse. As such, pulses will say as much about place as it will about people.

<!--I don't see the component of adding ways for users to also "dive into deeper reads of data, by crowdsourcing existing stories from neighboring API's such as Instragram and Twitter", assuming this is just something we haven't touched yet/ or feel might drop off in interest of time or resources? If possible it could be a useful addition - just my feel after talking briefly with Sophie at the hackathon, this is what she found most convincing about the project's value... Let me know if I can help curate resources around this, I could search for someone local here, or ask my bro:) -->



## Background
To state the obvious: cities are for people-not machines, not data scientists, not corporations.

Places, particularly broken down to the scale of a neighborhood, are really hard to quanitfy. Places are temporal and dynamic, changing dramatically over the course of a day, week, month, year.
