# Urban Heartbeat

Urban Heartbeat is an civic art project that explores the temporal identity and pulse of places in cities around the world. The project is part of the Data Canvas: Sense Your City competition, a DIY sensor project.

We will conduct several experiments based upon different environmental factors, such as pollution, noise, dust, and light. Each experiment explores a different factor using a different medium or visualization technique.

The primary goal of Urban Heartbeat is to empower the ability for any citizen to curate their own civic data search, and in turn, return customized search results in the form of information-rich, yet visually simplified format(s), or "pulses".

Over the course of 2 weeks, our team will begin by building a series of visualization experiments for representing select environmental factors, such as pollution, noise, dust, and light. Check out the latest experiments here: [Link to various Code Pen experiments]. We encourage you to fork these experiments into new ones, and have a say in how you'd like to see your city.

On March 20th, we'll combine the experiments into a web app/search engine that allows users to curate their own searches and compare pulses across 140 places in 10 international cities. Users will be invited to include select environmental factors as they find relevant to their search. Each environmental factor selected will contribute a "layer" onto a resulting urban pulse. As such, pulses will say as much about place as it will about people.

## Background
To state the obvious: cities are for people-not machines, not data scientists, not corporations.

Places, particularly broken down to the scale of a neighborhood, are really hard to quanitfy. Places are temporal and dynamic, changing dramatically over the course of a day, week, month, year.
